## Expressive Gradients
Weakly supervised lesion localization method for Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD) detection from Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) images.

> ### Abstract
> Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause 
of irreversible blindness among the elderly. Early diagnosis of AMD can
prevent vision loss, and careful treatment is essential. We propose a 
method of detecting AMD in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images 
in an explainable way. We present a new concise convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture, which outperforms existing models in terms
of accuracy. We also present a weakly supervised lesion localization 
algorithm called Expressive Gradients (EG), which outperforms conventional
Integrated Gradients (IG) algorithm in terms of coverage and hit rate.
We believe our method can serve as a CAD system to reduce clinicians'
workload in screening OCT images.
